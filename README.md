# RPi-Employee-Motivator
Motivate your employees by monitoring their git commits and frequency and 'motivating' them when they start slacking!

This repo contains the python code to program a raspberry pi to 'motivate/eltroctute' your employees to ensure they don't slack.

When a commit is made to a Github repo a CI build is triggered. Three LED lights are used to show the status of the build, if the build fails and the lights show red, you will receive an electic shock!
